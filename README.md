### Model Architecture

In 1D visualization, the red/blue line are representing the Probability Density Function for data generating from real/generator. <br>
And the dot line are the output for discriminator, where the higher value mean the discriminator believes the data is from real distribution more. <br>


### 2D visualization

In 2D visualization, the red/blue dots are the data points generating from real/generator. <br>
And the contour line are the output for discriminator, where the higher value mean the discriminator believes the data is from real distribution more. <br>
